# UQGVE

This is the official repository for the User-Query-Generator-Verifier-Executor architecture for the reliable KMDF instruction set generation for user queries based on endogenous generative LLMs. 

The databases and scripts provided here can be divided into the conference version and the journal version. 

The databases are designed to contain typical user queries in the natural language form while the scripts are implemented in Python programming language with Ollama supported. 

You can also generate multiple user queries for handling malware by connecting your prompts with malware datasets like those from \url{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravikiranvarmap/somlap-data-set}.
